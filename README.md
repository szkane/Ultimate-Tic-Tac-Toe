HTML5 version Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, Human VS AI (a Monte-Carlo Tree Search)

# Where is it come ？

最近在阅读《了不起的自驱力》这本书中，才知道超级井字棋（以前可能没留意）这个游戏。娃玩普通的井字棋已经玩厌了，于是就有了这个游戏。网上看了些 App，有免费的但有广告。就用 Gemini AI 做了这个游戏。

其中对战电脑的算法使用了 a Monte-Carlo Tree Search， 来自 Xing 同学的介绍 https://michaelxing.com/projects/ 。

Recently, while reading the book "The Great Self-Driving Force," I learned about the game Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe (I might not have noticed it before). My child was tired of playing regular Tic-Tac-Toe, so we introduced this game. I looked at some apps online, some were free but had ads. So, I used Gemini AI to generated this game.

The algorithm for playing against the computer uses a Monte-Carlo Tree Search, introduced by Xing at https://michaelxing.com/projects/.
